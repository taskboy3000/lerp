What if there is a pass where new source files are processed for metadata?

The data source has the list of source files listed into publication order.


schemes:

Posts                                           Tags
pubdate_file1 -> path/to/source_file1           tag1/pubdate_file1 -> path/to/source_file1
pubdate_file2 -> path/to/source_file2           tag1/pubdate_file2
                                                tag2/pubdate_file1

Fast sort time with ls or glob, need to open files to get sourcename
Can use mtime on db_entry to determine update

When a post is removed, it needs to be deleted from Posts and tags.
This may force the regeneration of:
  - recent_files
  - archives list
  - tags index
  - tag specific index
  - publication list
